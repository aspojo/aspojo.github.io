            <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
            <div class="text-left">
                <p>Prefixes are key morphemes in English vocabulary that begin words.  The English prefix <strong>ab-</strong>, which means “away,” appears in many English vocabulary words, such as <strong>ab</strong>sent, <strong>ab</strong>duct, and <strong>ab</strong>solute."  You can remember that the prefix <strong>ab-</strong> means “away” via the word <strong>ab</strong>sent, for someone who is <strong>ab</strong>sent is “away” from a place, such as school or work.</p>

            <article id="full-text" class="root-text text-left">
                <p>Today we will focus on the prefix <strong>ab-</strong>, which means “away.”  By the end of this podcast you will be <strong>ab</strong>solutely sure that <strong>ab-</strong> means “away!”</p>
                <p>Have you ever met someone who was <strong>ab</strong>normal, or “away” from being normal?  A person would be acting in an <strong>ab</strong>normal fashion if she were <strong>ab</strong>sent from class or work over half the time, that is, she was “away” more than she was present.  Or a person would really be <strong>ab</strong>normal if she could <strong>ab</strong>volate, or fly “away” on wings!</p>
                <p>Have you ever been <strong>ab</strong>solutely sure about something, so much so that you were loosened “away” from all doubt?  For instance, you might be <strong>ab</strong>solutely sure that you will never be <strong>ab</strong>ducted or led “away” by aliens, but then again, others apparently have … so can you be “away” from all doubt after all about that?</p>
                <p>If a queen were to <strong>ab</strong>dicate her throne, she would say that she wanted to be “away” from it, that is, step down from being a queen.  However, her people might love her so much that she would have to <strong>ab</strong>ort her plans, or be “away” from their rising successfully, thereby remaining on the throne.</p>
                <p>SpongeBob SquarePants, being a sponge and all, is really into <strong>ab</strong>sorbing water, or sucking it “away” from the surrounding ocean so that it goes into himself.  Although SpongeBob does like the soft water of the ocean, he probably wouldn’t like something <strong>ab</strong>rasive, like sandpaper, which would scrape or scratch “away” at his yellow holey awesomeness, which is just what someone like Plankton might do.  Although others might consider Plankton’s behavior to be <strong>ab</strong>errant, or wandering “away” from acceptable conduct, Plankton wouldn’t care as he scraped away in <strong>ab</strong>sent-minded, or maybe not so <strong>ab</strong>sent-minded glee!</p>
                <p>“Away” with this podcast since you are indeed now <strong>ab</strong>solutely in command of that English prefix!</p>

                        <h3>The Fascinating Parts of Words</h3>
                        <p>Morphology is the study of how words are put together by using morphemes, which include prefixes, roots, and suffixes.  Parsing the different morphemes in a word reveals meaning and part of speech.  For instance, the word “invention” includes the prefix <strong>in-</strong> + the root <strong>vent</strong> + the suffix <strong>-ion</strong>, from which is formed the noun “invention.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Etymology</strong> is that part of linguistics that studies word origins.  English vocabulary words are formed from many different sources, especially Latin and Greek.  By determining the origins of the morphemes in English words, one is better able to remember and determine the dictionary definitions of words.</p>
